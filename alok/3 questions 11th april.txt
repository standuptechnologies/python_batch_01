fabbonic series of 1st 10 using generator
a = int(10)
def fib(n):
    a=0
    b =1
    for i in range(n):
        yield a
        a=b
        b =a + b
print (list(fib(a)))

-----------------------------------
diffrence in between itearator and generator?

1.Iterator are objects which uses next() method to get next value of sequence. Generators: A generator is a function that produces or yields a sequence of values using yield method.
2.A generator in python makes use of the ‘yield’ keyword. A python iterator doesn’t.
3.we can implement your own iterator using a python class; a generator does not need a class in python.
